# seek-quench
Classic bioinformatic sequence alignment algorithms implemented into a simple open source web app. The project is named Seek Quench because it sounds like sequence and we are trying to *quench* answers that people are *seek*ing about their sequences.

## Goals
1. Implement a web application that takes in two nucleotide sequences, aligns them based on classic bioinformatic algorithms such as the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment, and outputs the results.
2. Allow more options!
	* different kinds of sequence alignments such as semi-global and local
	* multiple sequence alignment using Burrows–Wheeler transform
	* sequence conservation calculations such as sequence logos
	* phylogenetic tree construction
	* possibly other types of algorithms and options such as the profiles of PSI-Blast and Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM)
3. Think about future directions for this project.
